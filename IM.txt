INJECTION MOLDING 
The injection molding of thermoplastics is a 
process by which the plastic material is melted 
and then injected into the mold cavity. Once 
the melted plastic is in the mold, it cools to a shape 
that reflects the cavity and core. 
The resulting form usually is a finished part, needing 
no other work before assembly into or use as a 
finished product. Many details, such as bosses, ribs, 
holes, and screw threads can be formed during the 
one-step injection molding operation. 
The types of products produced by the injection 
process are almost too numerous to list. These 
products range from small drive wheels used in audio 
cassettes to body panels for automobiles. 
A detailed study of the operation of the injection 
molding machine is covered next. 
There are three basic types of injection molding 
machines in current operation. They are: the 
hydraulic machine, the hydraulic toggle machine. and 
the totally electric toggle machine. 
The Hydraulic Machine has one large cylinder in 
the center of the moveable platen with no mechanical 
advantage applied. It requires the most energy to 
operate and generates the most heat of the three 
machine types. 
The Hydraulic Toggle Machine is covered in 
detail later in this chapter. It is more energy efficient 
than the hydraulic machine. 
The Total Electric Machine generally has no 
hydraulic pumps. It is basically a toggle machine 
with the toggle being actuated by a servo motor used 
with a reduction drive gear to achieve the needed 
forces. All injection movement is also controlled by 
servo motors. A disadvantage is that it is relatively 
slower than either of the other two types of machines. 
The advantages are that it is much more stable since 
it has no hydraulic system to generate heat and the 
servo motors provide extemely accurate movement of 
the machine components. It is also much cleaner to 
operate than the other types of molding machines. 
PLASTIC INJECTION COMPONENTS 
1. HOPPER - The hopper is mounted on top of the 
injection unit and holds the plastic in its granulated 
fonn. It feeds the plastic into the injection unit. 
Plastic may be manually placed into the hopper or 
an apparatus may be installed which will 
automatically feed the plastic material into it. The 
material is gravity fed into the screw flights. This 
area is water cooled to prevent the melted plastic 
from feeding back into the plastic granules. (ref. page 
2-7) 
2. SCREW MOTOR - The screw motor is used to 
rotate the auger screw, forcing the plastic (granular) 
to advance along the flights toward the nozzle. The 
number of turns the screw motor is rotated as well 
as the pitch of the screw flights dictate how much 
plastic may be fed into the mold (up to but not to 
exceed the capacity of the molding machine itself). 
The screw motor may therefore be considered a 
metering device. 
3. INJECTION UNIT - The injection unit is made 
up of the carriage, the ban•el, the auger screw, the 
hydraulic cylinders, and the bairel heaters. The 
injection unit melts the plastic and injects it into the 
mold. (A more detailed description may be found on 
page 2-6) 
4. BARREL - The barrel houses the injection 
screw and is wrapped with heater bands. The molten 
plastic is forced through the barrel and out of the 
nozzle into the mold. 
(A more detailed description may be found on pages 
2-6 & 2-7) 
5. NOZZLE - The nozzle is the tip of the injection 
unit which mates with the mold base thus allowing 
for the flow of the molten plastic into the mold. The 
nozzle usually has a radiused (rounded) tip to allow it 
to center into the mold. 
MOLD CLAMPING AND EJECTION COMPONENTS 
1. STATIONARY PLATEN - The stationary 
platen is the non-moveable platen with the "A" side 
of the mold attached. The nozzle protrudes through 
the platen to mate with the mold. In those machines 
Illnning molds with hot manifolds, the stationary 
platen should be water cooled. 
2. NOTCHED SAFETY BAR This is a safety 
feature found on most molding machines. The 
notched safety bar is generally attached to the 
moveable platen. When properly adjusted, it will not 
allow the moveable platen to move fonvard until the 
operator guard door is closed. This action lifts the 
safety drop bar from the path of the notched safety 
bar which allows the moveable platen to close. 
3. MOVEABLE PLATEN - The moveable platen 
is the platen that the "B Il side of the mold is attached 
to. It moves horizontally on the tie-bars and applies 
clamping force to the mold. It also holds the ejector 
system. 
4. EJECTOR SYSTEM Through the use of an 
independent hydraulic ram, the ejector system pushes 
on the ejector plate in the mold ejecting the parts 
from the mold at a specified time in the molding 
cycle. (A more detailed description of the ejector 
system is found on page 2-9). 
5. EJECTOR CYLINDER - The ejector cylinder 
is the hydraulic ram that applies force to the ejector 
system which in tum, evacuates the molded plastic 
pmts from the mold. 
6. CLAMP TOGGLE Through pressure applied 
to the clamp toggle by the clamp cylinder, the clamp 
toggle applies the force that holds the moveable 
platen in the forward position thereby clamping the 
mold closed. (A more detailed description is found on 
page 2-8). 
7. TIE-BAR - The tie-bars support the platens and 
keep them parallel and pelpendicular to each other. 
This, in turn, assur.s that the mold will remain 
parallel and perpendicular for accurate alignment and 
minimum wear on shut-off surfaces. The tie-bars 
also guide the moveable platen through the opening 
and closing sequence in the molding cycle. 
8. TIE-BAR ADJUSTMENT 
With the 
tremendous forces being applied to the tie-bars 
during clamping (10 to over 1,000 tons of pressure) 
the tie-bars will stretch. therefore, they must be 
adjusted periodically to keep the platens tlue. 
9. CLAMP CYLINDER - The clamp cylinder is 
the hydraulic ram which provides the force needed 
to close the mold and lock the toggles during the 
molding cycle. It also opens the mold in order to 
provide for plastic part ejection following the 
injection and cooling cycles. 
10. CLAMP ADJUSTING RING GEAR This 
motor driven bull gear engages all four tie bar 
adjusting nuts 
in order to actuate them 
simultaneously when rotated. The ring gear drive 
motor is confrolled through the molding machine 
CPU in the set-up position. 
When new molds are set into the machine, the ring 
gear is backed off sufficiently to allow the moveable 
platen to move toward the mold (by actuating the 
clamp cylinder) and lock the clamp toggles without 
contacting the mold. At this point, the ring gear is 
rotated until the moveable platen makes contact 
with the mold. The clamp toggle is then backed off. 
This action opens the mold at the P/L. The ring gear 
is then adjusted toward the mold until the desired 
clamp force is achieved when the toggles are locked. 
11. 
DRIVE UNIT - The drive unit contains the 
motors, pumps, solenoids, valves, and reservoirs 
needed to keep the molding machine operational. 
12. 
CONTROL PANEL - The control panel 
contains the electrical circuitiY and controls ne e d e d 
to operate the injection, ejection, clamping, cycling 
and safety systems of the molding machine.
INJECTION MOLD AND AUXILIARY COMPONENTS 
1. WATER MANIFOLD - Hoses connect the 
manifold to the water circuits in the mold to provide 
cooling so that the plastic solidifies into the desired 
form in as short a period of time as possible. There 
are both water feed and return lines in the manifold. 
Feed lines are usually blue and return lines red in 
color. 
2. AIR MANIFOLD - Some molded parts require 
air assisted ejection to fall free from the mold. Air 
nozzles from the air manifold are mounted on or 
intemally machined within the mold to apply a small 
jet of air at ejection. Occasionally valve gates in Hot 
Manifold systems are air actuated. These may need 
to be activated in both open and close directions. 
These are just two applications for which the air 
manifold may be used. The solenoids, which activate 
the air manifold, are usually controlled by the Central 
Processing Unit (CPU) in the molding machine. 
3. MOLD The mold is shown in the above 
illustration from a top-view to illustrate the position 
of the ejector housing. The housing is normally 
mounted in the vertical plane to prevent debris from 
catching on the ejector plates and restricting ejection. 
Covers are sometimes mounted over this area to 
prevent plastic parts, granules, or other debris from 
entering the ejector housing. 
4. MOLD CLAMPS A minü-num of eight (8) 
clamps are generally required to hang the mold in the 
molding machine (4 on each mold half). They are 
bolted to the platens and clamped into the clamp slots 
in the mold base. The mold must be aligned to the 
ejector bars radially prior to tightening the mold 
clamps. 
5. HYDRAULIC MANNOLD - When a mold 
requires hydraulic pressure, i.e., unscrewing rack, 
hydraulic slides. etc., the molding machine can 
provide the hydraulic pressure via the hydraulic 
manifold. The sequence of the hydraulic in and out 
activation is controlled within the molding cycle by 
the CPU of the molding machine.
This portion of the injection molding machine is 
called the injection unit or the "sled". 
It gets its 
nickname because the entire unit can hydraulically 
slide away from the mold along tracks or rails. This 
is necessary to allow access to the nozzle. When 
changing plastic resin type, getting rid of 
contaminated or degraded material (due to it being in 
the barrel at melt temperature for a prolonged period 
of time) it is necessary to purge the material from the 
ban•el before it enters the mold. The injection unit 
must be moved away from the mold to accomplish 
the purging action. The injection unit position must 
also be adjustable because sprue bushing seat 
positions may vary mold to mold. 
Injection unit sizes are called out based on the 
maximum amount of plastic material they can 
dispense with one forward stroke of the injection 
screw plunger assembly. For example, a 20 ounce 
injection unit is capable of injecting a maximum of 
20 ounces of plastic into a mold in each shot. Plastic 
matelial may be injected into a mold in amounts less 
than 20 ounces by metering less material in front of 
the screw before injecting.

The plasticizing unit of the Inolding machine is made 
up of a heated barrel, nozzle, reciprocating screw, 
check ring, hydraulic cylinder(s), and rotary 
hydraulic motor. 
The reciprocating screw is attached directly to the 
hydraulic ram at the end of the unit. The ram is also 
connected to a hydraulic motor which gives the 
system two separate motions. The screw can be 
pushed forward as a plunger or it can be rotated as an 
auger. 

The actual injection sequence staffs in the middle, in 
other words there must be melted plastic (metered 
plastic material) at the front of the screw to start the 
sequence (as illustrated). *Ihe reciprocating screw is 
pushed forward. acting as a plunger to push the 
melted plastic through the nozzle and into the mold. 
This is done at very high pressure. During the 
injection, the check ring closes so that the melted 
plastic in front of the screw is sealed off and cannot 
escape back down the flights of the screw. 
When the mold is full, the injection pressure is kept 
up to force even more plastic into the mold to make 
up for the shrinkage that occurs as the plastic cools. 
This process is called "packing" and is accomplished 
in the hold sequence of the molding cycle. Packing is 
only effective until gates in the mold cavities solidify 
or "freeze-off. 'f 
When the packing process is complete and the mold 
is held closed during the cooling cycle, the 
reciprocating screw begins to rotate, moving the 
check ring off its seat and advancing more plastic 
along its flights to the front of the screw. Since the 
plastic has nowhere to go, it builds up pressure which 
pushes the screw back. If the screw were allowed to 
back up without resistance there would not be 
sufficient compression of the plastic to generate heat 
and compact the plastic; therefore, a small amount of 
hydraulic pressure is kept behind the screw to 
provide some resistance. This is done through a 
restriction on the return line of the hydraulic screw 
motor. 
The back pressure (compression) and the shear of the 
plastic as it moves past the screw flights while the 
screw rotates generate friction. This compression 
and friction generate heat which accounts for up to 
70% of the heat needed to melt the plastic. The rest 
of the needed heat is provided by the heater bands 
which sunound the barrel. Thermocouples are 
incozporated to control the amount of additional heat 
applied. 
When the ban•el has melted enough plastic for the 
next shot, the screw will have been pushed back 
through screw rotation and back pressure, as 
described above, to a predetermined position. This 
can be witnessed by looking at the plastic metering 
indicator (shown on page 2-6). At this point the 
rotation stops. The mold is opened following the 
allotted cooling time. The plastic parts are evacuated 
from the mold and the mold closes. The screw is 
again used as a plunger to inject the next shot of 
melted plastic into the mold as tlle cycle repeats. 

Toggle Clamp Injection Molding Machines are the 
most common in use today palticularly in the smaller 
tonnage machines. The toggle clamps are popular 
since they are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. 
They are also more economical to operate than a 
hydraulic clamp machine since smaller hydraulic 
pumps and cylinders are required. A hydraulic clamp 
machine requires a very large cylinder in the center 
of the platen to apply full clamp tonnage with 
hydraulic pressure only and no mechanical 
advantage. (This variation is not illustrated). The 
toggle clamp machine features include; a high 
mechanical advantage at lockup, built-in clamp slow- 
down, slow mold breakaway, and rapid clamp 
operation. The clamp cylinder moves the crosshead 
forward, extending the toggle links and moving the 
moveable platen forward. As the clamp closes, the 
mechanical advantage is low, resulting in rapid platen 
movement. As the platen approaches the mold-close 
position, the toggle links move from a high-speed/low 
mechanical advantage to a low-speed/high 
mechanical advantage. This low speed is critical for 
mold protection and high mechanical advantage is 
necessary to provide the needed clamping pressure, 
Once the linkage is fully extended, hydraulic pressure 
is not needed to hold the tonnage. It is important to 
note that the tie bars are slightly longer in the 
clamped state than they are in the static state relative 
to the tonnage being applied. 

To open the clamp, hydraulic pressure is applied to 
the opposite side of the clamp cylinder, slowly 
opening the mold to prevent damage to the molded 
pms. The entire sequence is controlled by the CPU 
in the molding machine. 

 
In this, the final phase of the molding cycle, the 
plastic parts are evacuated or ejected from the mold. 
The injection mold is generally designed so that the 
plastic pans stay with the "B" side of the mold upon 
mold opening. 
When the moveable platen opens the mold at the 
parting line (P/L) to the point that the plastic parts 
may be ejected, the moveable platen stops and the 
ejection cylinder is energized. The ejection cylinder 
then activates the ejector platen. The movement of 
the ejector platen is transferred to the ejector system 
within the mold itself by the ejector rods. The mold 
ejector system in turn ejects the plastic parts from the 
mold. This completes the molding cycle. 
To speed up the molding cycle, many times the 
ejection is activated "On the Fly". When the parting 
fine opens and the parts clear the "A" side of the 
mold, the ejection is activated so that the parts are 
free of the mold by the time the opening motion 
stops. In this way, the mold does not have to stay 
open while the parts are ejected but may be 
immediately closed. 
In other cases, the ejection is not activated until a 
robot comes in contact with the parts. This delay 
allows the parts to be removed without being 
damaged or may be done for orientation purposes in 
assembly equipment. As with the other phases of the 
molding cycle previously covered, the ejection is 
controlled by the CPU of the molding machine.
