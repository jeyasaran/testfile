INJECTION MOLDING 
The injection molding of thermoplastics is a 
process by which the plastic material is melted 
and then injected into the mold cavity. Once 
the melted plastic is in the mold, it cools to a shape 
that reflects the cavity and core. 
The resulting form usually is a finished part, needing 
no other work before assembly into or use as a 
finished product. Many details, such as bosses, ribs, 
holes, and screw threads can be formed during the 
one-step injection molding operation. 
The types of products produced by the injection 
process are almost too numerous to list. These 
products range from small drive wheels used in audio 
cassettes to body panels for automobiles. 
A detailed study of the operation of the injection 
molding machine is covered next. 
There are three basic types of injection molding 
machines in current operation. They are: the 
hydraulic machine, the hydraulic toggle machine. and 
the totally electric toggle machine. 
The Hydraulic Machine has one large cylinder in 
the center of the moveable platen with no mechanical 
advantage applied. It requires the most energy to 
operate and generates the most heat of the three 
machine types. 
The Hydraulic Toggle Machine is covered in 
detail later in this chapter. It is more energy efficient 
than the hydraulic machine. 
The Total Electric Machine generally has no 
hydraulic pumps. It is basically a toggle machine 
with the toggle being actuated by a servo motor used 
with a reduction drive gear to achieve the needed 
forces. All injection movement is also controlled by 
servo motors. A disadvantage is that it is relatively 
slower than either of the other two types of machines. 
The advantages are that it is much more stable since 
it has no hydraulic system to generate heat and the 
servo motors provide extemely accurate movement of 
the machine components. It is also much cleaner to 
operate than the other types of molding machines. 
PLASTIC INJECTION COMPONENTS 
1. HOPPER - The hopper is mounted on top of the 
injection unit and holds the plastic in its granulated 
fonn. It feeds the plastic into the injection unit. 
Plastic may be manually placed into the hopper or 
an apparatus may be installed which will 
automatically feed the plastic material into it. The 
material is gravity fed into the screw flights. This 
area is water cooled to prevent the melted plastic 
from feeding back into the plastic granules. (ref. page 
2-7) 
2. SCREW MOTOR - The screw motor is used to 
rotate the auger screw, forcing the plastic (granular) 
to advance along the flights toward the nozzle. The 
number of turns the screw motor is rotated as well 
as the pitch of the screw flights dictate how much 
plastic may be fed into the mold (up to but not to 
exceed the capacity of the molding machine itself). 
The screw motor may therefore be considered a 
metering device. 
3. INJECTION UNIT - The injection unit is made 
up of the carriage, the banâ€¢el, the auger screw, the 
hydraulic cylinders, and the bairel heaters. The 
injection unit melts the plastic and injects it into the 
mold. (A more detailed description may be found on 
page 2-6) 
4. BARREL - The barrel houses the injection 
screw and is wrapped with heater bands. The molten 
plastic is forced through the barrel and out of the 
nozzle into the mold. 
(A more detailed description may be found on pages 
2-6 & 2-7) 
5. NOZZLE - The nozzle is the tip of the injection 
unit which mates with the mold base thus allowing 
for the flow of the molten plastic into the mold. The 
nozzle usually has a radiused (rounded) tip to allow it 
to center into the mold. 
MOLD CLAMPING AND EJECTION COMPONENTS 
1. STATIONARY PLATEN - The stationary 
platen is the non-moveable platen with the "A" side 
of the mold attached. The nozzle protrudes through 
the platen to mate with the mold. In those machines 
Illnning molds with hot manifolds, the stationary 
platen should be water cooled. 
2. NOTCHED SAFETY BAR This is a safety 
feature found on most molding machines. The 
notched safety bar is generally attached to the 
moveable platen. When properly adjusted, it will not 
allow the moveable platen to move fonvard until the 
operator guard door is closed. This action lifts the 
safety drop bar from the path of the notched safety 
bar which allows the moveable platen to close. 
3. MOVEABLE PLATEN - The moveable platen 
is the platen that the "B Il side of the mold is attached 
to. It moves horizontally on the tie-bars and applies 
clamping force to the mold. It also holds the ejector 
system. 
4. EJECTOR SYSTEM Through the use of an 
independent hydraulic ram, the ejector system pushes 
on the ejector plate in the mold ejecting the parts 
from the mold at a specified time in the molding 
cycle. (A more detailed description of the ejector 
system is found on page 2-9). 
5. EJECTOR CYLINDER - The ejector cylinder 
is the hydraulic ram that applies force to the ejector 
system which in tum, evacuates the molded plastic 
pmts from the mold. 
6. CLAMP TOGGLE Through pressure applied 
to the clamp toggle by the clamp cylinder, the clamp 
toggle applies the force that holds the moveable 
platen in the forward position thereby clamping the 
mold closed. (A more detailed description is found on 
page 2-8). 
7. TIE-BAR - The tie-bars support the platens and 
keep them parallel and pelpendicular to each other. 
This, in turn, assur.s that the mold will remain 
parallel and perpendicular for accurate alignment and 
minimum wear on shut-off surfaces. The tie-bars 
also guide the moveable platen through the opening 
and closing sequence in the molding cycle. 
8. TIE-BAR ADJUSTMENT 
With the 
tremendous forces being applied to the tie-bars 
during clamping (10 to over 1,000 tons of pressure) 
the tie-bars will stretch. therefore, they must be 
adjusted periodically to keep the platens tlue. 
9. CLAMP CYLINDER - The clamp cylinder is 
the hydraulic ram which provides the force needed 
to close the mold and lock the toggles during the 
molding cycle. It also opens the mold in order to 
provide for plastic part ejection following the 
injection and cooling cycles. 
10. CLAMP ADJUSTING RING GEAR This 
motor driven bull gear engages all four tie bar 
adjusting nuts 
in order to actuate them 
simultaneously when rotated. The ring gear drive 
motor is confrolled through the molding machine 
CPU in the set-up position. 
When new molds are set into the machine, the ring 
gear is backed off sufficiently to allow the moveable 
platen to move toward the mold (by actuating the 
clamp cylinder) and lock the clamp toggles without 
contacting the mold. At this point, the ring gear is 
rotated until the moveable platen makes contact 
with the mold. The clamp toggle is then backed off. 
This action opens the mold at the P/L. The ring gear 
is then adjusted toward the mold until the desired 
clamp force is achieved when the toggles are locked. 
11. 
DRIVE UNIT - The drive unit contains the 
motors, pumps, solenoids, valves, and reservoirs 
needed to keep the molding machine operational. 
12. 
CONTROL PANEL - The control panel 
contains the electrical circuitiY and controls ne e d e d 
to operate the injection, ejection, clamping, cycling 
and safety systems of the molding machine.
